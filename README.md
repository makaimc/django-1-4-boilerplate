Django 1.4 Project Boilerplate
==============================

This is what I use as my base project boilerplate for Django 1.4 projects
so that I have:
1. Fabric file that can immediately deploy to a Ubuntu 10.04 server
2. "core" app with templates
3. Customized settings.py and local_settings.py
4. Deployment configuration specified
5. Bootstrap ready for customization
